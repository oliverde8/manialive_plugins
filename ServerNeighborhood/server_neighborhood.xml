	Refresh the Panel every [INT] seconds.

	5-10 sec. on low visited servers (cpu intensive, lag in game)
	10-30 sec. on high volume servers (less cpu intensive, less lag in game)

	If you wish to save the Server-Information to a remote destination e.g. on a FTP-Server
	just use the following format "ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/serverneighbors/"
	NOTE: Make sure your php option "allow_url_fopen" is set to "on" and the given path exist!

	If you wish to save the Server-Information local, then make sure that the path to the files
	are read- and writeable by the user that runs xaseco (see "man chmod" under UN!X/Linux)!

	Some examples for <storing_path>:
	 - Linux (local):		<storing_path>/home/user/serverneighbors/</storing_path>
	 - Windows (local):		<storing_path>C:/Trackmania/serverneighbors/</storing_path>
	 - FTP (remote):		<storing_path>ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/serverneighbors/</storing_path>

	The server neighbors, max. 56 servers!
	<path> = path to the "<login of dedicated server neighbor>_serverinfo.xml" including the filename, with the same conditions as <storing_path> (but only for read access)
